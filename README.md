# ðŸ“š Book Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of books using machine learning algorithms, focusing on the **Random Forest Regressor**. We also explore and compare other regression models to see how they perform on this dataset. The project follows a structured pipeline, from data collection to model evaluation, to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**  
   - Understand the dataset features, types, and initial trends.
   - Check for missing values, outliers, and feature types.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical features.
   - Feature selection and engineering, such as creating new features from the existing ones.

3. **Modeling**
   - Implement and train multiple regression models:
     - **Random Forest Regressor** (main model)
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor
   - Evaluate each model and fine-tune the **Random Forest Regressor**.

4. **Evaluation and Comparison**
   - Use metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **RÂ² score** to evaluate and compare model performance.
   
5. **Conclusion and Analysis**
   - Draw insights from model performance, highlight the best-performing model, and discuss any potential improvements.
